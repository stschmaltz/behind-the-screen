# Character System

Characters in the system include players, enemies, and NPCs, all managed through a common interface.

## Key Types
- `EncounterCharacter`: Base interface for all character types
- `InitiativeOrderCharacter`: Specialized interface for characters in combat with initiative tracking
- `Player`: Player character type with additional fields

## Important Operations
- Characters must be uniquely identified by their `_id` field, not by name
- Character updates should maintain immutability patterns
- Always use ID-based operations for updates, deletes, and lookups instead of name-based operations
